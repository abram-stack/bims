        <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

        <p className='description'>
          Hey my name is Bram and I&apos;m web developer passionate about the
          front end (at least for now 🤙🏾). I just finished pursuing my Computer
          Science Bachelor Degree at Frankfurt University Of Applied Sciences,
          in Frankfurt, Germany. I worked on my Bachelor Thesis with the
          <span className=''> sustainability</span> aspects of developing
          websites with help of frontend frameworks.

          Growing plants takes time. Good harvest needs good care and dedication
          and it creates its own satisfaction and that is what gives me my
          unique perpective as a frontend web developer.
        </p>
        <h3>Where its all started</h3>
        <p className='description'>
          Heard of Dreamweaver? Ouff, that was decades ago. At that time, when i
          designed my first ever website in junior high school. Not the perfect
          rocket launch, I&apos;d say. However, some years later, the older
          version of me encouraged himself and found the passion and fun to try
          to conquer the world beyond knowledge.
        </p>

        <p className='description'>
          Trial and error is no taboo. I learn and re-learn many times until I
          grasp it and have the magnificent A-ha moment that I&apos;ve been
          waiting for.
