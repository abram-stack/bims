          Heard of Dreamweaver? Ouff, that was decades ago. At that time, when i
          designed my first ever website in junior high. Not the perfect rocket
          launch, I&apos;d say. However, some years later, the older version of
          me encouraged himself and found the passion and fun to try to conquer
          the world beyond knowledge.

          and it creates its own satisfaction and that is what gives me my
          unique perpective as a frontend web developer. As I continued my
          journey at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences in Germany, where
          I studied Computer Science, I worked and researched of the

          {' '}aspects of and possibilites for websites.

          grasp it and have the A-ha moment that I&apos;ve been waiting for.
